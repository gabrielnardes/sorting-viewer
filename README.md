## 🤔 Why yet another algorithms visualizer?
I wanted to learn front-end development, so it seemed like a good project to start it out.

## 😮 That rocks! Where can I see it?

Generate ordinal array will shuffle the bars. If you play with this, the graph will become a nicely rightly triangly.

Generate random array will create bars with, guess what, a random value! God knows what it will become...

Play fast are for the ones interesting in raising the edge of ultimate computer performance.

Play slow are for the ones interesting in analyse every change, every nuance, every breath, you take... It has a different color set, to show you all of the changes and movements of the bars.
